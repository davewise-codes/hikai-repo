## How It Works

**Badge:** How it works

**Title:** Turn progress into *visibility*

**Subtitle:** Hikai captures what's happening and delivers it to your audience in four clear steps.

### Step 1: Define & Connect

**Headline:** Let Hikai understand your product

**Body:**
Connect your product sources — GitHub, Linear, Notion, and more — and define a clear baseline for what your product is. All in minutes.

From this context, Hikai automatically builds a deep, business-oriented understanding of your product: what's being built, why it matters, and how everything fits together.

This product-centric foundation is set once and improves over time as your product evolves.

**Bullets:**
- Setup in minutes
- Product-first, not tool-first
- One baseline that evolves over time

**Feature Card:**
- Title: Product context & taxonomy
- Description: Define what your product is and generate a structured, evolving taxonomy automatically.

  - Connect your product sources
  - Let Hikai build your product taxonomy

### Step 2: Product Timeline

**Headline:** Your product, over time

**Body:**
Hikai automatically tracks every product event across your stack — features, fixes, improvements, and changes — on the cadence you choose.

Each event is interpreted, grouped, and placed into a living, shareable product timeline that reflects real progress over time.

No manual reporting. No status updates.
Just a continuously updated view of what's happening in your product, translated into a timeline your audience can actually understand.

**Bullets:**
- Fully automated by default
- Consistent over time
- Audience-aware interpretation

**Feature Card:**
- Title: Automated product timeline
- Description: A living timeline that interprets product changes and adapts language to each audience.

### Step 3: Editorial Content

**Headline:** The effortless way to communicate your product

**Body:**
From your product timeline, Hikai generates content proposals that follow a consistent editorial line.

Each update is automatically adapted for your market, users, and stakeholders — without starting from a blank page.

Instead of isolated efforts, you get a systematic, repeatable way to communicate what your product is doing and why it matters.

**Bullets:**
- Editorial continuity built-in
- Marketing, customers, and stakeholders
- Zero starting friction

**Feature Card:**
- Title: Editorial content proposals
- Description: Generate consistent, audience-specific content proposals from your product timeline.
- Links:

### Step 4: Make It Yours

**Headline:** Human control. Keep your voice.

**Body:**
Review, refine, and publish using purpose-oriented editing and publishing tools.

Hikai handles the heavy lifting, but you stay in control of tone, emphasis, and narrative.

The result feels human — because it is.
Your judgment defines the story your product tells to the world.

**Bullets:**
- Your judgment, final word
- Narrative over automation
- Never sounds like AI

**Feature Card:**
- Title: Purpose-oriented editing & publishing
- Description: Edit and publish with tools designed to preserve intent, voice, and clarity.
- Links:

## Before vs After

**Badge:** Visibility shift

**Title:** Marketing on *autopilot*. Let your product progress speak for itself.

**Subtitle:** Your product was growing quietly in the dark. Hikai automatically turns that progress into a steady narrative your audience can actually follow.

### State A: Before

**Label:** When communication depends on constant effort

**Headline:** Progress goes unnoticed

**Body:**
- Your product is moving forward, but that progress goes unseen.
- Marketing feels like work you don't have time for.
- Updates stay locked in commits, tickets, or docs nobody reads.
- Weeks go by without contact with your audience.

### State B: After

**Label:** When progress runs on its own

**Headline:** Your product stays present

**Body:**
- Content spreads naturally across channels.
- Updates keep flowing, even when you're focused elsewhere.
- The market reacts.
